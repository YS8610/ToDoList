# To Do list website for 1 user  

The website is generated by spring boot and data will be saved to Redis. The To do list will show the tasks added when user submits each new task. When the task is saved, the data will be saved toRredis. And when it is loaded, it will be loaded from Redis.  

## Setting Application Properties  
The setting for redis is set in src\main\resources\application.properties. These properties need to be set before redis can be used for saving and loading of data.  
  
To run,  
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
